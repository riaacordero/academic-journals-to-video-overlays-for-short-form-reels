am i the asshole for not wanting to read through academic journals?

this passion project converts long-read academic journals to digestible video content.

**Notes:**
- venv files are ignored due to size. to install dependencies use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- to avoid storage issues, data folder is in a separate link you can download [here]
